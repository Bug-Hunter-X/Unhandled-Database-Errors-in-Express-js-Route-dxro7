# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route

This example demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: neglecting to handle potential errors during database operations.  The `/users/:id` route attempts to fetch user data. If the user is not found, it correctly returns a 404. However, it lacks error handling for database query failures (e.g., connection issues, invalid queries).  This could lead to server crashes or inconsistent behavior.

The `bug.js` file showcases the flawed code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that includes robust error handling using `try...catch` blocks and appropriate status codes.
